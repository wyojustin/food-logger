GOALS for New Version of Food Logger
================================================

(MUST HAVE)
-----------
1. One button per food type on the main GUI
   - Replaces drop-down for faster touchscreen logging

2. Save a permanent record of every entry AND deletion
   - Suggest using a lightweight SQLite3 database (with timestamps, type, source, and action type)

3. Fix bug where the first item is not recorded
   - Possibly related to GUI not refreshing scale value before first record()

(NICE TO HAVE)
--------------
4. Email report generation
   - Auto-send summary reports at intervals (e.g., daily or weekly)
   - Could attach CSV or summary PDF

(SUGGESTED ADDITIONS)
---------------------
5. Modular code structure (GUI logic, scale interface, storage)
   - Easier to test and maintain

6. Offline-first design
   - Avoid cloud dependency; sync only when requested

7. CSV export from database
   - GUI option to export per-source/per-day logs

8. Logging and error recovery
   - Log file for scale disconnects, errors, or corrupted inputs

9. Future support for other scale types
   - Abstract scale input logic

10. Localized date/time format
   - Adapt timestamp format based on user region
